Vim-TTR is a Vim plugin that allows a developer to run their RSpec tests in the adjacent tmux pane. Similar existing plugins either overtook the whole Vim window or opened a split, reducing the number of visible lines. By running the tests in the adjacent pane, users can run specs without interruption and use the existing tmux pane layout.

  <li>Run whole spec file</li>
  <li>Clear screen before every spec run, reducing terminal noise</li>
