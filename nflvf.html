NFL Video Finder is a web app that lets a user input a link to a video on NFL.com and returns one or more direct links (mp4/m3u8) to that video.

It does this by looking through the page source for both the video links and JSON pages which may also have the links. It finds all the ones it can then consolidates them into one helpful list.
